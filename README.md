Short Summary of Design Patterns.

I will implement Facade design pattern to help with interface to a complex program. This will be a Section between the user and the complex algorithmic code.

Then, I will impement Factory or an Abstract Factory to create objects that are similar in nature and that need a multipy of in the program. Like enemy units.

Lastly, I will implement Singleton pattern to implement the player who will go through the game. Its perfect for this case, we only need a single player for our RPG game.

There are many more interesting design patters that look very appealing. I might also use decorator for enemies, choosing their classes/attacks.
